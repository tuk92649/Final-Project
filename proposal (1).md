# Proposal## What will (likely) be the title of your project?Poker with AI opponent## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")A poker game that you play with AI opponents.## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?My software will randomize the cards that are distributed amongst each player. Then it will implement the rules of Poker, taking into consideration all of the special rules. I will try implementing a Monte Carlo simulation where we run the program over and over again, keeping track of the results of each simulation. This will be executed using PyGame. I do not know yet what features my program will have that will be apart of my research.## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?I am not planning on combining this course's final project with another course's final project.## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.I am not planning on collaborating with any other classmates.## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?I will accomplish having all of the rules of poker working when running the program.### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?I think I can accomplish a working game with an AI opponent. ### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?I hope to accomplish a working game with multiple AI opponents. ## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?I will need to research the rules of poker. I have to make sure I research the different special situations, like straight flush, four ok a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair, pair, high card, etc. I will research different features that I can include in the game. I will also research if there are any engines or files that I would need to import.
